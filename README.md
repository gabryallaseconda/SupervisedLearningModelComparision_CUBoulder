# Supervised Models Comparison on Student Performance dataset


Project for Deep Learning at CU Boulder

Data from UCI repository ([Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance))


Code is organized as follows:
- Exploratory.ipynb contains exploratory analysis and data preprocessing;
- LinearModels.ipynb provide predictions using linear models also with regularization, including a backward elimination for feature seleciton;
- Trees.ipynb provide predictions using decision trees and ensembles like random forest and gradient boosting
- Catboost.ipynb provide predictions using catboost 
- Test.ipynb contains the testing procedure for all the best models for each of the above
- submission.ipynb is a merge of the previous notebookst for CU Boulder submission
